Description: Package for importing WhatsApp Chatlogs and parsing them into
    a usable dataframe object. The parser works on chats exported 
    through Android or iOS phones and and Linux and Windows Machines. It might work on MacOS
    too but was not tested for that. The parser has  multiple options for extracting smilies and emojis
    from the messages, extracting urls and domains from the messages, extracting names and types of send 
    media-files from the messages, extracting timestamps from messages, extracting and anonmizing author 
    names from messages.
