## Description
This is an R-package to import exported WhatsApp chatlogs, parse them into a usable dataframe format and thereby enable further analysis. This parser was built with the goal to work with chat logs extracted on Android as well as iOS devices, run on Linux, Mac and Windows, and to be able to handle multiple languages. Currently, only English and German are supported, but in principle, other languages could be added relatively easily (see below). The repo also contains a function to scrape and update the emoji_dictionary, should new emoji be added to WhatsApp in the meantime.

## Use Cases
<!--
1. The use cases section should contain a list of use cases relevant to the social sciences.
2. Each use case should start with a description of a task and then detail how one can use the method to assist in the task.
3. Each use case may list publications in which the use case occurs (e.g., in APA7 style, https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references/examples).

## Input Data

This method uses WhatsApp-Chatlogs (in german and english language) as Input. Check the respective faq to see how to extract logs from WhatsApp.
  - For Android Phones: [https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/android/23756533/?category=5245251](https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/android/23756533/?category=5245251)
  - For Iphones: [https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/iphone/20888066/?category=5245251#email](https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/iphone/20888066/?category=5245251#email)

### Does this parser work with other languages too?

Currently, only chats exported from phones set to *German* or *English* are supported. Other languages can be added by appending the `languages.csv` file with the necessary regular expressions to differentiate system messages from user generated content. In addition, `parse_chat` would need to be adapted and additional tests would have to be added. If you would like to add a language, please consider doing so via a pull request in this repository.

## Output Data

The parse_chat() method outputs an R data frame where each row represents a single WhatsApp message from the chat log. It includes structured columns such as timestamp, sender, and message text, making the conversation machine-readable and ready for analysis.
The package also includes some functions to compute additional metrics and visualize them. We will provide some basic examples for chats with two participants and for group chats with multiple participants here, for a complete overview, you can check the [documentation](man/) or the [figure section](man/figures/). The used chat is a chat that was parsed with the `anonimize = TRUE` parameter to exclude participant names. All plotting functions include multiple types of plots and additional parameters to restrict the range of the data.

#### Message Distribution

Distribution of sent Messages.

```
plot_messages(data, plot = "cumsum", exclude_sm = TRUE)
```

![](man/figures/plot_messages()_cumsum.png)

### Token Distribution

Distribution of sent Tokens (words).

```
plot_tokens(data, plot = "violin", exclude_sm = TRUE)
```

![](man/figures/plot_tokens()_violin.png)

#### Tokens over Time

Distribution of sent Tokens per Person over time

```
plot_tokens_over_time(data, plot = "hours", exclude_sm = TRUE)
```

![](man/figures/plot_tokens_over_time()_hours.png)

#### Wordcloud

Wordcloud of sent tokens, seperately for each participant.

```
plot_wordcloud(data, comparison = TRUE, exclude_sm = TRUE, font_size=50, min_occur= 300)
```

![](man/figures/plot_wordcloud()_comparison.png)

#### Lexical Dispersion Plot

Occurrences of keywords in the chat. Example keyword is "Weihnachten" (Christmas).

```
plot_lexical_dispersion(data,keywords = c("weihnachten"), exclude_sm = TRUE)
```

Consecutive messages by the same chat participant are summarized into one "session". The shown plot is simple image, the actual output is an interactive HTML object, see [man folder](/man/).

```
plot_network(data)

## Hardware Requirements

This package runs on any hardware that can run R.

## Environment Setup


 - If on Windows, `RTools` needs to be installed and working
 - The `RJava` package needs to be installed and working
 - plotting emoji requires the `ragg` package and you need to set your graphics backend to `AGG` (In Rstudio: Tools > Global Options > Graphics > Backend)

### Installing it

```R
 # for the most up-to-date GitHub version
 library(devtools)
 devtools::install_github("gesiscss/WhatsR")
 # from CRAN
 install.packages("WhatsR")
```

## How to Use

### Parsing 

```R
 # parsing it
 simulated_parse_chat <- parse_chat("PATH/TO/YOUR/EXPORTED/FILE.txt")
  # plotting it
 plot_emoji(simulated_parse_chat, plot="bar")
```

#### For testing you can create a simulated dataset:

```R
 # creating simulated chatlog (saved in working directory)
 simulated_raw_chat <- create_chatlog(language = "english")
 # parsing it
 simulated_parsed_chat <- parse_chat("Simulated_WhatsR_chatlog.txt")
 # plotting emojis contained in chat
 plot_emoji(simulated_parsed_chat, plot="bar")
```
